今天做完一半的英文朗读任务后，突发奇想，对比了下1 月刚开始读英文和现在读英文时，自己的改变。

听下来，感觉1 月的朗读者操着一口不太自信、囫囵吞枣的 Chinglish，而 400 小时后的自己仿佛“新生”一般：自信、字正腔圆、有些韵律在其中……当然还有很多不足，不过这个进步，已经给了我足够的动力继续前行。



第一个是 2024 年1 月 13 日刚开始英语朗读时录的音频：

Script：

> Why learn English?
>
> First up, it enhances my capabilities in English speaking, listening, reading and writing. Despite 20 years of learning, I am good at English Reading but not in English Speaking. It's a shame, I ought to seize this chance to improve.
>
> Secondly, sticking to English sets a benchmark for learning other stuff like Shanghai dialect, Cantonese, Japanese, guitar playing, calligraphy ,etc.!
>
> Thirdly, it boosts my writing skills, making me consciously gather materials daily to churn out better spoken phrases, coined as "input driven by output". 
>
> Last but Most importantly, once I walk the talk, it's highly beneficial for my significant other and future children’s education. The best way children learn is by seeing their parents do it. So, in the long run, my pursuit of learning English is also a commitment to building a better family.



第二个是2024 年 8 月 3 日朗读时候的音频：

> There is a right way and a wrong way to snack 
>
> by Andrea Peterson.
>
> America is a nation of snackers. A lot of us are doing it wrong. Noshing outside of traditional meal times isn't inherently bad. A snack can stave off hunger, boost energy, provide important nutrients, and keep us from overeating later. But snacking can also lead us to eat extra calories and overdo it on sodium. Added sugars in saturated fats, which can raise our risk of heart disease and obesity. How to snack better? Reach for food combinations that keep you full longer. Pair carbs like apple slices with proteins and fats like peanut butter. Then plan your snack times and watch out for the minefield that is evening snacking.
